    "You might be wondering, \"*why all the excitement about linear regression?*\"  It so happens that regression is one of the workhorses of machine learning, and it also underlies other more complex types of models.  The advantage of regression models is that they are highly interpretable and very stable when it comes to training/fitting. In fact, linear regression models, particularly multiple linear regression with many input predictors, can mimic a lot of the power of more complex models, such as neural networks, while maintaining their computational stability and interpretability. There is a long running joke/meme about companies that claim to use \"machine learning\" actually use linear regression (and logistic regression, which we'll soon see more of). This isn't entirely a joke though since even if a company is using very powerful/complex types of models (e.g. deep neural networks), they will almost always have already tried using a linear regression model because it would be the cheaper and faster solution.  In other words, linear regression is almost always the default modeling approach, and is sometimes hard to beat!\n",

For instance if your roommate is prone to late night partying and being grumpy the next day you might mentally fit a model to the experiences you have and \"learn\" what features are predictive of them being grumpy.

    "What we've looked at so far is commonly referred to as *Simple Linear Regression*, which is when there is one *predictor* (or *feature* or *independent variable*), $x$, and we are trying to predict the *outcome* or *response* or *dependent variable*, $y$. Linear Regression is a powerful and commonly used tool though, so you can imagine that it's not too difficult to add more predictors. Below is an example where we'll try fitting a *Multiple linear Regression* model, which is a linear regression model with more two or more *predictors* (or *features* or *independent variables*).\n",

    "Nice work completing this notebook. If you didn't already appreciate the power of linear regression, hopefully this helped convince you in some way. Even though we will use lots of other types of models, you will almost always want to start with linear regression because of its simplicity, stability, and flexibility. We'll always want to use the *right model for the task at hand* though, so we probably don't want to be too much like either of the people below :) \n",
